# YOLO Custom Training for OAK-D Camera
This branch of the repository deals with training custom dataset for our graduation project.

The weighted result from training will be uploaded on [Luxonis Tools](https://tools.luxonis.com/) to compile a
blob and JSON configuration for use with our OAK-D camera.

Below are the notebooks for every version we worked with. (Links TBA)
- [YOLOv5](https://kaggle.com/)
- [YOLOv6](https://www.kaggle.com/code/bumbleboss/yolov6-training)

### Notes
If you wish to have your own dataset implemented on our notebooks, make sure you are using a [YOLO PyTorch TXT](https://roboflow.com/formats/yolov5-pytorch-txt) annotation format.
